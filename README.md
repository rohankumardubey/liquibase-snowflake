# liquibase-snowflake 

# DEPRECATED

**As of Liquibase 4.12.0, Snowflake support ships directly in Liquibase and this extension is no longer needed.**

If you are adding this extension to your Liquibase CLI or to your project a dependency with 4.12.0+, you should remove that dependency to avoid code conflicts.

# Snowflake Extension
[Liquibase](http://www.liquibase.org/) extension to add [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.net/) support.  This repo should be considered the canonical version of the Snowflake extension and represents the latest and greatest version.

Initial release supports applying formatted sql changesets.  It might support other types of refactorings but they haven't been tested.  Some of the interesting overrides / extensions are documented below.

## Database

### currentDateTimeFunction

Snowflake's `current_timestamp` function returns a `timestamp_ltz` datetype, while
the `datetime` Liquibase datatype maps to a Snowflake `timestamp_ntz` column.  To avoid exceptions, the current_timestamp
 is cast to a `timestamp_ntz`.   Without the cast, exceptions of the form given below occur.

    SQL compilation error: Expression type does not match column data type, expecting TIMESTAMP_NTZ(9) but got TIMESTAMP_LTZ(9)

### getJdbcCatalogName

The Snowflake JDBC drivers implementation of `DatabaseMetadata.getTables()` hard codes quotes around the catalog, schema and
table names, resulting in queries of the form:

    show tables like 'DATABASECHANGELOG' in schema "sample_db"."sample_schema"

This results in the `DATABASECHANGELOG` table not being found, even after it has been created.  Since Snowflake stores
 catalog and schema names in upper case, the getJdbcCatalogName returns an upper case value.

### getJdbcSchemaName

See [getJdbcCatalogName](#getJdbcCatalogName)

## Datatype Mappings

### datetime

The `datetime` datatype in Snowflake is an alias for the datatype `timestamp_ntz`, [Date and Time Data Types](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/sql-reference/data-types.html#date-and-time-data-types).
The `TimestampNTZType` class clarifies this mapping from Liquibase `datetime` to Snowflake `timestamp_ntz`.
To map `text` datatype in changesets to `text` Snowflake datatype SnowflakeTextDataType class is added (default liquibase-core classes maps it to `CLOB`)

## ChangeLog

2020-02-02 : upgrade to liquibase 3.8.5


## Using the Liquibase Test Harness in Extensions
The liquibase-snowflake extension now comes with integration test support via the liquibase-test-harness. 

For more information on using the test-harness to test the snowflake extension, see [README.test-harness.md]
